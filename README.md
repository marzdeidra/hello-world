# hello-world
Just familiarizing myself with the awesomeness that is GitHub!


My name is Marcia, but my nickname is Marz. I'm hailing from Brooklyn, New York and just a few steps away from gorgeous Prospect Park Lake, that houses some of the hungriest, most aggressive geese on the planet! My favorite things are traveling, writing, shopping, trying new and exotic foods, and napping.

I love all things spirituality and magical. I also love writing!
